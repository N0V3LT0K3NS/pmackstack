## Working Features

1. **Brand Switching**: Users can switch between Kilwins and Renoja using the dropdown in the sidebar
2. **Renoja Dashboard**: Displays real-time KPIs including:
   - Total Members & Net Growth
   - Retention Rate
   - Average Member Rate
   - Digital Engagement Metrics
   - Event & Partnership Tracking
3. **Data Entry**: Renoja managers can submit weekly data with:
   - Auto-fill of continuing metrics (total members, avg rate)
   - Automatic retention rate calculation
   - Success/error feedback
4. **Store Filtering**: Both brands can filter by their respective stores
5. **Date Range Filtering**: View metrics for different time periods

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- renoja_weekly_metrics table includes:
- Weekly actionables (digital_posts, reviews, partnerships, events)
- Measured results (new/lost members, total members, avg rate)
- Calculated fields (net_member_change, retention_rate)
- Proper constraints and indexes
```

### API Response Format
```typescript
// Dashboard response includes:
{
  summary: {
    newMembersTotal, totalPayingMembers, membersLostTotal,
    avgMemberRate, retentionRate, totalEvents,
    totalDigitalPosts, totalGoogleReviews, totalPartnerships
  },
  timeSeries: [...weekly data points...]
}
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Charts Implementation**:
   - Member trends line chart
   - Engagement metrics stacked bar chart
   - Retention analysis visualization

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - CSV import for Renoja data
   - Email notifications for low retention
   - Comparative analytics between stores
   - YoY comparisons

3. **UI Polish**:
   - Brand-specific color themes
   - Custom icons for Renoja metrics
   - Mobile responsiveness improvements

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migrations run successfully
- [x] Sample data loads correctly
- [x] API endpoints return expected data
- [x] Brand switching works seamlessly
- [x] Data entry form submits successfully
- [x] KPIs calculate correctly
- [x] No regression in Kilwins functionality

## Deployment Notes

1. Run migrations in order: 004a, 004, 005, 006
2. Ensure environment variables are set for both brands
3. Clear cache after deployment
4. Verify sample data if needed for demos

## Known Limitations

1. Charts are placeholders (not yet implemented)
2. No CSV import for Renoja (manual entry only)
3. No email notifications yet
4. Mobile view needs optimization

## Success Metrics

✅ Users can switch between brands
✅ Renoja data model completely separate from Kilwins
✅ All CRUD operations working for Renoja
✅ No performance degradation
✅ Clean separation of concerns in code
